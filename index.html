		<p>  I have been a property manager for about eight years now and I have seen nearly every possible way of destroying a property; be it an apartment or just a room in a house, tenants can damage and destroy nearly anything. </p>
		<p>  I had a tenant who rented a room in our house once who showed up to our "fancy dinner party" with friends and family in attendance completely naked. <br><img src ="images/gasp.gif" alt He was very drunk and I tried to put him to bed on the couch, but he urinated on the couch and the blanket.  I got him a new blanket and moved him to a dry couch only for him to do it again a few minutes later.  Finally, I moved him to a third (leather) couch and rejoined the dinner.  </p>
		After a while, I became concerned because I heard a sound like water dripping or splashing near the entryway to our house.  We had a toilet that sometimes would run indefinitely and it had once flooded the entryway two floors below it, so I ran upstairs to check it, but as I went to the second floor, there was no sign of the water or sound of running water.  Upon decending the stairs, I saw the source was our (still naked) tenant was now urinating on the radiator just inside the door. </p>

		<p> If you are thinking of owning rental property, remind yourself of this story and of the fact that this was only one night of my eight year tenure in the business.</p>
